## Authors

## Phase 1: Problem Brainstorm

### Problem

- Discord is a popular communication platform that can be used to exfiltrate data
- Data exfiltration can be done in many ways, such as:
  - Sending messages
  - Sending files
  - Using voice channels

### Idea to solve (TODO: Update)

### What data to collect

- Types of data that can be collected:
  - Flow data
  - Packet captures
  - Discord logs
- > 1 milhão de fluxos

### How to collect data (TODO: Update)

- [ ] Analyze what type of data discord makes
- [ ] Evaluate what data can be collected

### How to produce data (TODO: Update)

- [ ] Check out discord API
- [ ] Check out ways to make automated data collection
- [ ] Make tree types of bots
  - [ ] Periodically easy to detect
  - [ ] Randomly in a period of time, intermediate to detect
  - [ ] Exfiltration through embedded images, hard (almost impossible) to detect
